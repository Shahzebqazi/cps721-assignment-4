%(i) What is the shortest flight to China from Toronto? (We understand shortest as taking the minimal time. Also, the
flight that takes time longer than time taken by another flight between same two cities is called below a long
flight.)

I THINK IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT ITS NOT WORKING FOR ME 


%(j) Is there a morning flight from Canada to New York that arrives there before 1pm? (We interpret morning as any
%time between 5am and 9am, and assume that a morning flight is a flight that departs in the morning. Similarly,
%day flights are flights that depart from 9am to noon, afternoon flights depart from noon to 5pm, and evening
%flights depart from 5p to 10pm. You can assume that no flights depart between 10pm and 5am.)

[1:47 AM] Shahzeb: hey i edited the file a bit since the database would not be able to answer some of the queries further down the assignment
[1:48 AM] Shahzeb: clone it: https://github.com/Shahzebqazi/cps721-assignment-4.git
[1:48 AM] Shahzeb: i also started working on the lexicon and added the parser that was given to us in class
[1:49 AM] Shahzeb: will retest the queries you made and complete the ones we are missing
[1:49 AM] Shahzeb: then we need to work on completing the lexicon (q2)
